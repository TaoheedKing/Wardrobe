# Wardrobe Instructions
A wardrobe at the very least should include:

Tops (shirts, tank tops, sweaters)
Bottoms (pants, skirts, shorts)
Jackets (light jackets, rain jackets or heavy coats)
Shoes (rain boots, sneakers, dress shoes, sandals)
The user should also be able to input optional accessories (hats, scarves, gloves, jewelry, scarves, handbags) or create their own categories.

Each wardrobe item should have:

A category
Color
Long/short sleeves or Long pants/shorts
Fabric material
An image of that item

The application should allow new users to sign up for an account and track their wardrobe items. Users can update information regarding each of their items or remove items from their wardrobe.

Users should also be able to create packing lists for upcoming trips using items from their wardrobe.

To Log in as a user, the username/password is user/user. Or, you can sign up to create a new account. For an administrative role, the username/password is admin/admin
